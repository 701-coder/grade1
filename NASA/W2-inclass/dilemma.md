# Firewall dilemma
The firewall device in our department becomes unstable one week before the midterm exam, as described in the class today. What would you do to restore service to normal? Please explain your plan and how it can minimize the impact to the users.

我會先發公告給大家，說明防火牆出了問題，將在明天凌晨開始進行整修，預計整修到中午，整修期間會暫停系上的一些服務。然後我會盡全力儘快把防火牆修好，讓服務盡早恢復。我會這麼做的原因是：
1. 我沒有馬上整修，而是發公告，因為要讓使用者有充足的時間能應變
2. 我選擇明天凌晨開始整修，而不是段考完，因為不想讓使用者暴露在資安的風險中

# NTU COOL video incident
NTU COOL has lost most of the encoded video files due to an incident, as described in the class today. How do you dispatch the CPU resources to encode the video uploaded for the new semester and the old videos from previous semesters? Please explain your plan and how the plan can minimize the impact to the user.
